BlindMaps
=========

An open initiative for independent mobility.

Join us in building a low-cost navigation system for the blind and visually impaired so that everyone can have the freedom of independently exploring and navigating in an unknown urban environment*.

Using mostly open hardware/software, we are building a series of simple & low-cost prototypes of Bluetooth-enabled haptic interfaces integrated in a white caneâ€˜s grip with beacons.

These prototypes can be connected to smartphones and beacons using Bluetooth Low Energy (such as iBeacon) and can be rebuilt, improved and be modified by Makers around the globe.
